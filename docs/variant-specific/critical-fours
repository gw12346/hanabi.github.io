These conventions apply to any variant with critical fours.

<br />

### The 4 Save

- Players must save fours with a number clue. (This is analogous to _5 Saves_.)

### Miscellaneous

- _Critical color bluffs_ take precedence over _4 charms_. Since all fours are critical, a color clue to any four is never a _4 charm_. (_Double bluffs_ and _4 charms_ must be with number.)
