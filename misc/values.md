# H-Group Values

## Politeness

- People play Hanabi from all over the world, so put in work to be polite. It can be easy to misinterpret someone if you can't see their face.

## Kindness

- No one wants to play games with someone who has a mean streak. Try to stay positive.

## Patience

- Your patience _will_ be tested, especially by new players (and some more than others). But have a little empathy; we were all there once.

## Inclusion

- Over time, players in this group retire, and they hardly ever come back. Without new players, **this group will die**.
- Be open to playing with new players, at least some of the time.
